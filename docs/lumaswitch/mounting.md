# Mounting

LumaSwitch has four 5mm (0.2") through-holes in each corner of the device, on a 0.5" pitch. These holes can accomodate #10 or M4 bolts. The enclosure is electrically isolated, so there is no need to make sure your mount is isolated from the robot frame. Furthermore, LumaSwitch can also be mounted with zip ties using the notches on top of the enclosure.
