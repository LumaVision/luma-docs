# Flashing OS

!!! warning
    Before flashing your device, make sure you back up your pipeline settings and camera calibration as the flashing process will wipe these settings. 

    If you are using PhotonVision, you can usually just use the Offline Update feature instead of flashing the OS, which will preserve your settings.

## Prerequisites
1. Download and install RPIBoot tool
    * Windows: [Download](https://github.com/raspberrypi/usbboot/raw/master/win32/rpiboot_setup.exe)
