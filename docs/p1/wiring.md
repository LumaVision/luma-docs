# Wiring Options

## Radio PoE (Recommended)
The simplest and most reliable method of wiring P1 is by utilizing the Vivid Hosting radio's PoE output.

Simply connect the radio to P1 with an ethernet cable and switch on the PoE dipswitch for the port its plugged into.

## PoE Injector
If you do not wish to use PoE from the radio or would like to connect P1 to an ethernet switch, you can still power P1 via PoE by using a PoE injector or custom PoE cable. Use a 5A or 10A fuse in the slot powering the PoE injector or cable.

## Weidmuller Connector
If not using PoE, or you would like to have redundant power, P1 can also be powered through the Weidmuller connector next to the ethernet port. Use a 5A or 10A fuse in the slot powering the device.
